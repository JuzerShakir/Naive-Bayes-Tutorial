#### Requirements

This project requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Python 3.6.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-366/)      (Language Used for the project)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)                                        (For Data Analysis)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)                           (ML Library for Python)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

#### Execution

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `____` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook report.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook report.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter/iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
